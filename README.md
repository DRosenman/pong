# pong
Browser version of the classic game "pong".

I edited this game http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=pong.js, from the p5.play example library. I changed it so that instead of having the user control both pong sticks simultaneously, the right stick acts as the "computer stick".
